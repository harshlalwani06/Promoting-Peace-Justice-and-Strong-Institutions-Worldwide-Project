        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>Armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in long-standing grievances among communities.</p>
        <p>Violence also affects children's health, development, and well-being, causing trauma and weakening social inclusion.</p>
        <p>Lack of access to justice means that conflicts remain unresolved, and people cannot obtain protection and redress. Institutions that do not function according to legitimate laws are prone to arbitrariness and abuse of power, and less capable of delivering public service to everyone.</p>
        <p>To exclude and discriminate not only violates human rights but also causes resentment and animosity, which could give rise to violence.</p>
        <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
        <p>High levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development. Sexual violence, crime, exploitation, and torture are prevalent where there is conflict or no rule of law.</p>
        <p>Governments, civil society, and communities need to work together to find lasting solutions to conflict and insecurity. Strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights is key to this process, as is reducing the flow of illicit arms, combating corruption, and ensuring inclusive participation at all times.</p>
        <h2>How Does This Apply to Where You Live?</h2>
        <p>Goal 16 aligns with the broader human rights framework by promoting societies that respect and uphold individual rights, as well as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, and access to information.</p>
        <p>Peace is a fundamental precondition for social and economic development. Without peace, societies are often plagued by conflict, violence, and instability, hindering progress and resulting in the loss of lives and resources.</p>
        <p>Equal access to justice is essential for protecting the rights of individuals, resolving disputes, and ensuring that vulnerable populations are not marginalized or mistreated.</p>
        <p>Crimes threatening peaceful societies, including homicides, trafficking, and other organized crimes, as well as discriminatory laws or practices, affect all countries.</p>
        <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
        <p>Exercise your rights to hold your elected officials accountable, seek freedom of information, and share your opinions with your representatives. Promote inclusion and respect for people of different ethnic origins, religions, genders, sexual orientations, or differing opinions.</p>
